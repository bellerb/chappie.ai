# AI
### Description
The following is a generalized reinforcement learning AI program. This AI is trained using a combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary learning. This AI is based off of [DeepMind's](https://deepmind.com/) [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265) algorithm where it uses a Neural Network in combination with the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm. However the Neural Network (NN) used in this AI differs from MuZero since in their papers they use a convolutional neural network (CNN) where with this AI a [Perciver IO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795) based architecture is used.
